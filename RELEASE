RELEASE 2.0.0

The first release of version 2.0. See RELEASE-2.0 to see changes leading
from version 1.2 to 2.0.

RELEASE 2.0.1

- Bug #69 - vactables type was being referenced before UPGRADE FUNCTIONS could actually have created it, when upgrading from an earlier version.

  This would cause UPGRADE FUNCTIONS to fail.

- Bug #64 - use of syslog levels had some inappropriate break statements so that some logging would get lost.

- If you had multiple clusters where one cluster name was a substring of the other, slon-tools.pm could find
  both when looking for slon processes relevant to the shorter cluster name.  Added a space to the relevant
  bit of slon-tools.pm

- Failover had an insert into sl_event where # of columns provided didn't match those expected.  This
  resulted from the change of snapshot handling which used to involve 3 columns where in 8.3+, there is
  now a snapshot type.


RELEASE 2.0.4
